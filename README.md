# Brain Size Prediction Project üß†

## Description
The Brain Size Prediction project aims to predict brain size based on various factors using machine learning techniques. Leveraging a dataset containing information about individuals' brain sizes and other relevant features, this project demonstrates the ability to predict brain size accurately.

## Overview
The project utilizes machine learning algorithms to analyze the dataset and build a predictive model. By considering factors such as age, gender, and other physiological characteristics, the model learns to predict brain size and provides insights into the relationship between these factors and brain size.

## Libraries Used üìö
The project harnesses the following Python libraries:
- NumPy üßÆ
- Pandas üêº
- Matplotlib üìä
- scikit-learn üß™

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   
```bash
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install matplotlib
pip install scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Load the dataset containing brain size information.
2. Preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if applicable.
3. Split the dataset into training and testing sets using the `train_test_split` function from scikit-learn.
4. Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., linear regression) and train the model using the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics, such as the coefficient of determination (R-squared score).
6. Make predictions on new data to predict brain size based on input features.

## Model Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using the coefficient of determination (R-squared score), which measures the proportion of the variance in the target variable (brain size) that is predictable from the input features.

## Contributing
Contributions to the project are welcome! If you'd like to contribute enhancements or additional features, feel free to fork the repository and submit a pull request.
